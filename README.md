Goal: Allow the user to add only categories. When added, the categories will appear on the user's home page. When clicked on, the categories will call their own version of GoalPage, where only their goals can be listed.

What's done:
Users can only call categories.
When clicked on, the categories will call their own version of Goal Page.

What's left:
Fix a bug where active categories aren't showing up reliably on the homepage. Possibly something to do with the method GetActiveCategories I made in DatabaseServices. Or something with the code I did in MainPage.xaml or MainPage.xaml.cs.
